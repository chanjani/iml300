            The New Yorker has a good layout because the spacing and length with the introduction summaries are not too long and congested. It is pleasing to the eye and not just throwing information at you. There is vertical rhythm throughout the website and in the articles.

        <a href="http://losangeles.craigslist.org/">

            Craigslist has a bad layout because it is not pleasing to the eye at all. Also, there isn't uniformity with the font size. Sometimes, smaller font size is necessary, but it does not make sense if it is in the same section as another category, like how "discussion forums" has smaller font sizes than "for sale". There isn't vertical rhythm either throughout the website.
